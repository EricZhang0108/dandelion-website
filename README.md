###What worked and didn't work
For this assignment, I tried to imitate the landing page of Figma with my paraody of it - Ligma. The flex boxes worked really well for me and helped with setting the layout and for the mobile page design. What didn't work so well were the hamburger menu. I tried to implement it for the mobile page but for some reason the CSS Checkbox Trick doesn't work when I try to toggle on the menu. I did get the checkbox to hide and be toggled but the effects were not produced. I also tried to make the Sign Up button fixed when you scroll down. However, it seems that requires JavaScript. I did make it so that the button can just be fixed, but it didn't look that great on the first page (at top of the scroll).
